Note, you must submit this form regardless if you use AI or not. Failure to submit this form will be considered a violation of AI course policy. More details about the AI-usage course policy can be found [here](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CMPT-276/#/ai-policy).

[Link to AI Usage Disclosure MS Form](https://parsa-rajabi.github.io/CMPT-276/#/ai-policy?id=disclosure-of-ai-use)

## Task 1: Website Wireframe

Include screenshots of your website wireframe here. Make sure the wireframe is clear and easy to understand/read. To compliment your wireframes, describe the layout and how the elements are organized. Screenshots that are blurry or hard to read will be penalized. 

In addition to the screenshots, you can also a link to your wireframe file (if you used an online tool to create it). Make sure the link is accessible to the teaching team (check using an incognito window). This is not a replacement for the screenshots, but an additional resource for the teaching team to understand your wireframe.


## Task 2: Follow-up Questions

For this task, please include your answers for the questions described in [Lab 4](L4.md) file below:

### Q1

Pull Requests (PRs) are a collaboration feature in GitHub that allow developers to propose changes to a repository. A PR lets contributors suggest code modifications from one branch to another before merging. It serves as a code review tool, enabling team members to review, discuss, and approve changes before they are merged into the main project. PRs also provide a record of changes and discussions, helping maintain code quality and preventing conflicts.


### Q2

Green (+34) → Indicates added lines of code in the pull request.
Red (-42) → Indicates removed lines of code in the pull request.
The image shows that 34 new lines were added, while 42 lines were deleted.


### Q3

git merge test:
Merges the changes from the test branch into the current branch (develop).
Git will combine the changes from test into develop.
If no conflicts exist, Git automatically merges the changes.
If conflicts exist, Git pauses the merge and asks the user to resolve them manually.


### Q4

The message appears because Git detected conflicting changes in the README.md file between the develop and test branches. This happens when:

The same line(s) of code were modified in both branches.
Git doesn’t know which version to keep, so it asks the user to manually resolve the conflict.
